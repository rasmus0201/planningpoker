Round finished:
    -> when all players voted
    -> when gamemaster forcefully ended round

1. Make an 'gamemaster' interface
    -> Start new round
    -> Start game (special 'start new round')
    -> See users votes (when round finished)
    -> Force 'finish' round?  (i.e. we don't want to wait for player(s) to vote)
2. Spectator user
    -> Can not do anything other than seeing votes

3. All user types (gamemaster, player, spectator)
    -> Have list of logged in users (logged in = have clientId set)
    -> Can see users' connection status (is connected to websocket)

4. Custom card?
    -> Type what you want



New database structure

1. Do it in mysql
2. Use eloquent

3. structure:

id|username|client_id|type (gamemaster, player, spectator)

connections:

games:
id|current_state (lobby, showoff, voting)

game_rounds:
id|game_id

game_votes:
